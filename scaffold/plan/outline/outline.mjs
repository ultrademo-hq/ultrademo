// outline.mjs — the outline step (D-91, D-93): between the brief and the directions, the high-level sequence of the video.
// The moments in order (a tutorial's steps), what each needs (its source, a sign-in, a change of data in the product),
// grouped into chapters for a long video; the sign-in tested before any direction work; and, when a step would create
// or change data, the user's two confirmations (a demo or test account; these records are okay). Without them those
// steps are rebuilt from screens (the skill's read-only law 2 holds everywhere else).
//
// The outline lives in plan.video.intake.outline:
//   { status: 'proposed' | 'confirmed', moments: [...], chapters: [...], signin: { path, tested_at, results }, data_ok, confirmed_at }
